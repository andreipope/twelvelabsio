## Header

The header contains a field named`TL-Signature`.This allows you to verify that the event was sent by Twelve Labs. The `TL-Signature` field is composed of two parts.

- `t` : A Unix timestamp representing the time when the API service has sent the notification

- `v1` : A signature generated uniquely for each webhook event, using `HMAC` with `SHA-256`. For instructions on how you can verify the signature, see the [Validate the Integrity of an Event](/guides/webhooks/requirements-for-processing-notifications#1.-validate-the-integrity-of-an-event) section.

## Response Schema

Responses are in JSON format and contain the following fields:

- `id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the notification.

- `created_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the API service has sent the notification.

- `type`: A string indicating the type of event. It can take one of the following values:

  - `index.task.ready`: Specifies that your video is ready to be searched
  - `index.task.failed:` Specifies that the video indexing task has failed.

- `data:` An object that contains the following information:
  - `id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the video indexing task.
  - `metadata`: An object containing the duration of the video.
  - `status`: A string representing the status of the video indexing task. For details about the possible statuses, see the [Indexes/Tasks](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks) page.
  - `engine`: The engine used to index the video.
  - `index_options`: An array of strings that determines how the engine processes your videos. For more details, see the [Indexing Options](/concepts/indexing-options) page.
  - `tags`: An array of strings representing the tags associated with this video indexing task
