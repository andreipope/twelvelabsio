title: "3. Transfer and Index Videos"
---

This guide shows how to transfer the files from your AWS S3 bucket to Twelve
Labs and index them.

<Note>
  The API service checks for duplicate files using hashes and will not upload
  the same video to the same index twice.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- You already downloaded the list of files in your AWS S3 bucket.

- Your videos must meet the following requirements:
  - **Video resolution:** must be greater or equal than 360p and less than 1080p
    (FHD)
  - **Duration**: must be between 15 seconds and 2 hours (7,200s) If you require
    different options, send us an email at `support[at]twelvelabs.io`.

## Recommendations

- For consistent search results, Twelve Labs recommends you upload 360p videos.

## Procedure

1. Declare the
   [indexes/tasks/transfers](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks-transfers)
   endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
INDEXES_TASKS_TRANSFERS_URL \= f"{API_URL}/indexes/tasks/transfers"
```

```json Node.js
const INDEXES_TASKS_TRANSFERS_URL \= \`${API_URL}/indexes/tasks/transfers\`
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Read your JSON file. Open a stream making sure to replace the placeholders
   surrounded by `<>` with your values:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
file_path \= "<YOUR_FILE_PATH>"
file_name \= "<YOUR_FILE_NAME>"
file_stream \= open(file_path, "rb")
```

```json Node.js
const file_path \= '<YOUR_FILE_PATH>'
const file_stream \= fs.createReadStream(file_path)
```

</CodeGroup>

3. If you're using Python, store the file to upload in an array named
   `file_param` and specify that you want to make a `multipart/form-data`
   request. If you're using Node.js, store the file to upload in a variable
   named `formData` of type `FormData`:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
file_param = [
    ("file", (file_name, file_stream, "multipart/form-data")),
]
```

```json Node.js
let formData = new FormData()
formData.append('file', file_stream)
```

</CodeGroup>

4. Upload the JSON file. Call the
   [indexes/tasks/transfer](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks-transfers)
   endpoint, store the result in a variable named `response`, and print the
   status code and response:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
requests.post(INDEXES_TASKS_TRANSFERS_URL, headers=headers, files=file_param)
print (f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
pprint (response.json())
```

```json Node.js
let config = {
    method: 'post',
    url: INDEXES_TASKS_TRANSFERS_URL,
    headers: headers,
    data : formData,
};
resp = await axios(config)
response = await resp.data
console.log(`Status code: ${resp.status}`)
console.log(response)
```

</CodeGroup>

The output should look similar to the following one:

```json Status code: 200
{
  "message": "Succesfully requested indexing task",
  "type": "index_task_create"
}
```
