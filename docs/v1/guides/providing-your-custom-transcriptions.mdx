title: "Providing Your Custom Transcriptions"

If an index has the `conversation` option enabled, the API service automatically extracts a transcription. However, if you already have a transcription file, you can provide it along with the video when requesting a video indexing task. Note that transcriptions must be in the SRT or VTT format.

Depending on how you want to upload your videos and provide transcriptions, proceed to one of the following sections:

[Providing Transcriptions From the Local File System](/guides/providing-your-custom-transcriptions/providing-transcriptions-from-the-local-file-system)

[Providing Transcriptions From URLs](/guides/providing-your-custom-transcriptions/providing-transcriptions-from-urls)
