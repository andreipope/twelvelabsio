title: "Performing Searches"
---

This section provides examples demonstrating how to perform searches. The API
allows you to perform the following type of searches by specifying the
[search_options](/concepts/search-options) parameter in the body of the request:

- **Visual**: Searches by objects, actions, sound, movements, places,
  situational events, and complex audio-visual text descriptions.

- **Conversation**: Finds the exact point in your video where the specified word
  or phrase is mentioned.

- **Text in video**: Searches for text that appears in the video.

<Note>
  The search options you specify must be a subset of the [indexing
  options](/concepts/indexing-options) used when you [created the
  index](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks#create-a-new-video-indexing-task).
