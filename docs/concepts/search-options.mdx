title: "Search Options"
---

Search options specify the source of information the search engine uses when performing a search. The following values are supported:

* `visual`: Allows you to search by objects, actions, sound, movements, places, situational events, and complex audio-visual text descriptions.

* `conversation`: Allows you to find the exact point in your video where the specified word or phrase is mentioned.

* `text_in_video`: Allows you to search for text that appears in your videos (OCR).

**NOTES**:

* The search options you specify must be a subset of the [indexing options](/concepts/indexing-options) used when you created the index.

* You can specify multiple search options in conjunction with the `operator` parameter to broaden or narrow your search. For examples, see the [Multiple Search Options ](/guides/performing-searches/multiple-search-options)page.
