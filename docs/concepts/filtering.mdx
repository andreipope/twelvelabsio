title: "Filtering"
---

All Twelve Labs API endpoints that return a list of results support filtering, but the implementation is slightly different depending on whether you query the`indexes` endpoint or want to filter your search results based on metadata.

Depending on your use case, proceed to one of the following sections:

[Indexes](/concepts/filtering/indexes)

[Filter Search Results Based on Metadata](/concepts/filtering/filter-search-results-based-on-metadata)
