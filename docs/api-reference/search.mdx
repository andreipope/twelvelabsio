### Response Schema

The response is in JSON format.

On success, it contains the following fields:

* `conversation_option`: Indicates the type of search the API performed (`semantic` or `transcription`

* `data`: An array that contains your search results. For each match found, the search engine returns the following fields:  
   * `start` and `end`: Start and end time of the matching video fragment, expressed in seconds.  
   * `video_id:` A string representing the unique identifier of the video vector. Once the API service indexes a video, it assigns a unique identifier. Note that this is different from the identifier of the video indexing task. To map the identifier of a video indexing task to the identifier of a video vector, you can use the `/indexes/tasks/:task-id/video-id`endpoint. For details, see the [Retrieve a Video Vector ID Based on a Task ID](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks#retrieve-a-video-vector-id-based-on-a-task-id) section.  
   * `metadata`: An array that contains details about each result. It has the following fields:  
         * `type`: A string that indicates the type of match (`visual`, `conversation`, `text_in_video`).  
         * `text`: For `conversation` and `text_in_video`, the API returns a transcription of the spoken words or the text that matches your search query.  
   * `score`: A quantitative value determined by the AI engine representing the similarity score between your search terms and the matching video fragment.  
   * `confidence`: A qualitative indicator measured by the internal QA team based on the value of the score field. This field can take one of the following values:  
         * `high`: For scores greater than 90 and less than 100  
         * `medium`: For scores greater than 80 and less than 90  
         * `low`: For scores greater than 70 and less than 80  
         * `extremely low`: For scores greater than 70 and less than 80.  
   * `thumbnail_url`: If thumbnail generation is enabled for this index, the API service retrieves a thumbnail from the middle of the matching video fragment. Note that the URL expires in one hour.

* `page_info`: An object that provides information about pagination. It has the following fields:  
   * `limit_per_page`: The maximum number of items on each page.  
   * `page_expired_at`: A string representing the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the page expires.  
   * `total_result`: The total number of results.  
   * `next_page_id`: The unique identifier of the next page.

* `query`: The search query you specified.

* `search_options`: The search options you used.

* `search_pool`: An object that contains details about the index you queried.

* `type`: Describes the type of operation (`search_create`)

On failure, it contains the following fields:

* `message`: A human-readable string describing the error.

* `error_code`: Represents the code associated with the error. See the [Error Codes](/reference/api-reference/error-codes) page for details.
