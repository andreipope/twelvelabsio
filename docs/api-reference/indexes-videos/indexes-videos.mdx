title: "Indexes/Videos"
description:
  "All API endpoints that are related to the indexed videos that are ready to be
  used for search."
---

When the API service indexes a video, it doesn't store it. Instead, the API
service saves all the required information needed to perform fast, semantic,
accurate, and scalable searches as lists of floating numbers. These lists are
named video vectors.

The `video_vector` object has the following elements:

- `_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of a video vector. The API
  service creates a new `video_vector` object and assigns it a unique identifier
  when the video has successfully been indexed, and it's ready to be searched.
  Note that video vector IDs are different from task IDs. To map a task ID to a
  video vector ID, see the
  [Retrieve a Video Vector ID Based on a Task ID](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks#retrieve-a-video-vector-id-based-on-a-task-id)
  section.

- `created_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  [video indexing task](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks) was created.

- `indexed_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  video has finished indexing.

- `metadata`: An object that contains the following information about the video:

  - `duration`
  - `filename`
  - `fps`
  - `height`
  - `size`
  - `width`

- `updated_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  video indexing task object was last updated. The API service updates this
  field every time the video indexing task transitions to a different state.
