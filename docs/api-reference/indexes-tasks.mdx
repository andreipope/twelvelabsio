A task represents a request to upload and index a video. A task starts when you
begin uploading your video by calling the
[**POST** method](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks#create-a-new-video-indexing-task)
of the `indexes/tasks` endpoint, and it can have one of the following statuses:

- **Validating:** Your video has finished uploading, and the API service is
  validating it by performing the following checks:

  - Resolution must be greater or equal than 360p and less than 1080p (FHD).
  - Duration must be between 15 seconds and 2 hours (7,200s).
  - Your video must contain an audio track.
  - Your video must not have missing frames.

- **Pending:** The API is spawning a new worker server to process your video.

- **Indexing:** The API is transforming the video you uploaded into vectors. A
  vector is like a compressed version of the video and contains all the
  information that Twelve Labs' deep-learning models need to perform fast,
  semantic, accurate, and scalable searches.

- **Ready:** Your video is ready to be searched.

Additionally, you may receive one of the error messages listed on the
[Error Codes](/reference/api-reference/error-codes) page.

The `task` object has the following elements:

- `_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the task. It is assigned
  by the API service when a new task is created.

- `created_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  task was created.

- `estimated_time`: A string indicating the estimated date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  video is ready to be searched.

- `index_id`: A string pointing to the index to which the video is assigned.

- `metadata`: An object that contains the following information about the video:

  - `duration`
  - `filename`
  - `height`
  - `width`

- `status`: A string indicating the status of the video indexing task.

- `updated_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  task object was last updated. The API service updates this field every time
  the video indexing task transitions to a different state.
