A task represents a request to upload and index a video. A task starts when you begin uploading your video by calling the [**POST** method](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks#create-a-new-video-indexing-task) of the `indexes/tasks` endpoint, and it can have one of the following statuses:

* **Validating:** Your video has finished uploading, and the API service is validating it by performing the following checks:  
   * Resolution must be greater or equal than 360p and less than 1080p (FHD).  
   * Duration must be between 15 seconds and 2 hours (7,200s).  
   * Your video must contain an audio track.  
   * Your video must not have missing frames.

* **Pending:** The API is spawning a new worker server to process your video.

* **Indexing:** The API is transforming the video you uploaded into vectors. A vector is like a compressed version of the video and contains all the information that Twelve Labs' deep-learning models need to perform fast, semantic, accurate, and scalable searches.

* **Ready:** Your video is ready to be searched.

Additionally, you may receive one of the error messages listed on the [Error Codes](/reference/api-reference/error-codes) page.

The `task` object has the following elements:

* `_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the task. It is assigned by the API service when a new task is created.

* `created_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the task was created.

* `estimated_time`: A string indicating the estimated date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the video is ready to be searched.

* `index_id`: A string pointing to the index to which the video is assigned.

* `metadata`: An object that contains the following information about the video:  
   * `duration`  
   * `filename`  
   * `height`  
   * `width`

* `status`: A string indicating the status of the video indexing task.

* `updated_at`: A string indicating the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the task object was last updated. The API service updates this field every time the video indexing task transitions to a different state.

## Create a New Video Indexing Task

Create a new video indexing task to upload a video to the API service and make it searchable. Note the following about creating a new video indexing task:

* To upload a file that resides on the local file system, pass the `video_file` parameter. It must be a stream of bytes encoded as `multipart/form-data`.

* To upload a file from a publicly accessible URL, pass the `video_url` parameter with the URL of your video. It must be a `string`.

* You must specify at least one of the `video_file` and`video_url` parameters. If you specify both the `video_url` and `video_file` parameters in the same request, the `video_url` parameter takes precedence over `video_file`.

* To provide a transcription file, you must set the `provide_transcription` parameter to `true` and specify at least one of the `transcription_file` and `transcription_url` parameters:  
   * Use the `transcription_file` parameter to provide a transcription from the local file system. It must be a stream of bytes encoded as `multipart/form-data`.  
   * Use the `transcription_url` parameter to provide a transcription file from a publicly accessible URL. It must be a `string`.
