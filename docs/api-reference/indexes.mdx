An index groups one or more videos stored as vectors and is the most granular level at which you can perform a search. The `index` object has the following elements:

* `_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the index. It is assigned by the API when an index is created.

* `index_name`: A string representing the name of the index.

* `index_options`: An array of strings that determines how the engine processes your videos. Twelve Labs currently offers three different indexing options: `visual`, `conversation`, `text_in_video.` For more details, see the [Indexing Options](/concepts/indexing-options) page.

* `created_at`: A string representing the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the index was created.

* `updated_at`: A string representing the date and time, in the [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the index was updated.

* `engine_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the engine that the API will use to index the videos in this index.

* `video_count`: An integer representing the number of video vectors in the index.

* `total_duration`: An integer representing the total duration of the videos in the index.

* `addons`: The list of add-ons that are enabled for this index.
