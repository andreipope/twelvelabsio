  "All API endpoints that are related to creating and managing index."

An index groups one or more videos stored as vectors and is the most granular
level at which you can perform a search. The `index` object has the following
elements:

- `_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the index. It is
  assigned by the API when an index is created.

- `index_name`: A string representing the name of the index.

- `index_options`: An array of strings that determines how the engine processes
  your videos. Twelve Labs currently offers three different indexing options:
  `visual`, `conversation`, `text_in_video.` For more details, see the
  [Indexing Options](/concepts/indexing-options) page.

- `created_at`: A string representing the date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  index was created.

- `updated_at`: A string representing the date and time, in the
  [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format, that the
  index was updated.

- `engine_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the engine that
  the API will use to index the videos in this index.

- `video_count`: An integer representing the number of video vectors in the
  index.

- `total_duration`: An integer representing the total duration of the videos in
  the index.

- `addons`: The list of add-ons that are enabled for this index.
