---

Use the `indexes/tasks/transfer` endpoint to perform cloud-to-cloud transfers
that allow you to group multiple video indexing operations in a single API
request by sending a `multipart/form-data` request. The request body must
specify a JSON file that contains an array. Each element of the array represents
a file to be uploaded and indexed and has the following fields:

- `index_id`: The unique identifier of the index with which the video file will
  be associated.

- `language:` The language of your video.

- `object`: The S3 URL of your video.

- `transcription`: The S3 URL of your transcription.
