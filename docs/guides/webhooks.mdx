A webhook allows your application to receive real-time HTTP notifications for events. Currently, this functionality is available for the following events:

- A video indexing task has finished indexing is ready to be searched.

- A video indexing task has failed.

## Use Webhooks to Receive Notifications

To receive event notifications for events in your application, use the steps in this section:

1. **Create an HTTP endpoint in your application**. The API service sends notifications to your endpoint as POST requests with a JSON payload. For details about the schema, see the [Notification Schema](/guides/webhooks/notification-schema) section.

2. **Register your webhook**. Once you've created an HTTP endpoint in your application, you must go to the **Dashboard** page and register your webhook in the **Settings** \> **Webhooks** section. For instructions, see the[ Register a webhook](/guides/webhooks/manage-webhooks#register-a-webhook) section.

3. **Handle requests**. Ensure that your application meets the [requirements for processing notifications](/guides/webhooks/requirements-for-processing-notifications).
