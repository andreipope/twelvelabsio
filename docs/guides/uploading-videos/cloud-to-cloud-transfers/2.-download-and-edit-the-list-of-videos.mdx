title: "2. Download and Edit the List of Videos"
---

The [Integrations](https://api.twelvelabs.io/integrations) page allows you to download the list of files in your AWS S3 bucket as a JSON. The structure of the JSON file is described on the [Indexes/Tasks/Transfers](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks-transfers) page. Once you've downloaded the JSON file, you can edit the fields in a plain text editor. For example, you can add transcription files or remove the files you don't want to upload and index.

## Prerequisites

- Before you can download the list of files in your AWS S3 bucket, you must [set up an integration](/guides/uploading-videos/cloud-to-cloud-transfers/1.-set-up-an-integration)_._

## Procedure

1. Go to the [Dashboard](https://api.twelvelabs.io/dashboard) page, and select **Integrations**:

4. _(Optional)_ You can edit your JSON file in a plain-text editor. For example, you can provide your custom transcription files, as shown in the following example:

\[

"language": "en",

"object": "s3://twelve-labs-docs/01.mp4",

"transcription": "s3://twelve-labs-docs/01.srt"
