title: "Upload From the Local File System"
---

In this guide you'll learn how to upload a video file from the local file system
to the API service.

Note that, although the example code in this guide is written in
[Python](https://www.python.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the API
is compatible with most programming languages, and you can also use
[Postman](https://www.postman.com) or other REST clients to send requests and
view responses.

## Prerequisites

- Your video must meet the following requirements:

  - **Video resolution:** must be greater or equal than 360p and less than 1080p
    (FHD)
  - **Duration**: must be between 15 seconds and 2 hours (7,200s) If you require
    different options, send us an email at support\[at\]twelvelabs.io.

- You're familiar with the concepts that are described on the
  [Understand](/understand) page.

- You've already created an index. For details, see the
  [Create an Index](/reference/api-reference/indexes#create-an-index) section.

## Recommendations

- For consistent search results, Twelve Labs recommends you upload 360p videos.

## Procedure

1. Declare the `indexes/tasks` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
INDEX_TASK_URL = f"{API_URL}/indexes/tasks"
const INDEX_TASK_URL = `${API_URL}/indexes/tasks`
```

```json Node.js
INDEX_TASK_URL = f"{API_URL}/indexes/tasks"
const INDEX_TASK_URL = `${API_URL}/indexes/tasks`
```

</CodeGoup>

2 . Read your video file. Open a stream, making sure to replace the placeholders
surrounded by `<>` with your values:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
file_name = "<YOUR_FILE_NAME>"
file_path = "<YOUR_FILE_PATH>"
file_stream = open(file_path,"rb")
```

```json Node.js
const file_path = '<YOUR_FILE_PATH>'
const file_stream = fs.createReadStream(file_path)
```

3. If you're using Python, store the index ID and the language of your video in
   a dictionary named `data` and the file to upload in an array named
   `file_param`. If you're using Node.js, store the index, the language of the
   video, and the file to upload in a variable named `formData` of type
   `FormData`:

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python



```

```json Node.js



```

</CodeGroup>

4. Upload your video. Call the
   [tasks endpoint](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks#creates-a-new-video-index-task)
   and store the result in a variable named `response:`

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

data = {
    "index_id": <YOUR_INDEX_ID>,
    "language": "en"
}
file_param = [
    ("video_file", (file_name, file_stream, "application/octet-stream")),]let formData = new FormData()

```

```json Node.js

let formData = new FormData()
formData.append('INDEX_ID', <YOUR_INDEX_ID>)
formData.append('language', 'en')
formData.append('video_file', file_stream)

```

</CodeGroup>

5. Store the ID of your task in a variable named `TASK_ID` and print the status
   code and response:

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python



```

```json Node.js


```

</CodeGroup>

6. _(Optional)_ You can use the
   [tasks/{\_id}](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks#get-the-status-info-of-the-video-index-task.)
   endpoint to monitor the indexing process. Wait until the status shows as
   `ready`:

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python



```

```json Node.js



```

</CodeGroup>

The output should look similar to the following one:

<Note>

- For details about the possible statuses, see the
  [Indexes/Tasks](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks) page.

- You can also use webhooks to monitor the status of the indexing process. For
  details, see the [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) section.
