title: "Cloud-to-Cloud Transfers"
---

Cloud-to-cloud transfers allow you to group multiple video indexing operations in a single API request. Initially, this feature is supported for the `us-west-2` region of AWS S3. Later, this feature will be extended to all the regions and other cloud providers. For details, see the [Roadmap](/roadmap) page.

The steps for performing a cloud-to-cloud-transfer are as follows:

1.  **Set up an integration**. When you set up an integration, you grant Twelve Labs access to read the files in your S3 bucket.

2.  2.  **Download the list of files in your S3 bucket**. After an integration is set up , you must open the [Integrations](https://api.twelvelabs.io/integrations) page to download the list of videos in your S3 bucket as a JSON file. Optionally, you can edit the file in a plain text editor.

3.  3.  **Transfer and index videos**. Invoke the `indexes/tasks/transfers` endpoint to transfer and index your videos.

The topics in this section provide instructions for managing integrations and making cloud-to-cloud transfers.
