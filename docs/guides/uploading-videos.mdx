---

- **Upload from the local file system**: Use this option to upload a single video file from the local file system to the API service.

- **Upload from a URL**: Use this option to upload a video file from a publicly accessible URL to the API service. The API service will download the file directly from the specified URL, so your application doesn't have to store the video locally and upload the bytes.

- **Cloud-to-cloud transfers**: Use this option to group multiple video uploading operations in a single API request.

Depending on your use case, proceed to one of the following sections:
