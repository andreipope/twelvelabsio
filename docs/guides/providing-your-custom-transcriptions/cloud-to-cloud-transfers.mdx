Cloud-to-cloud transfers allow you to group multiple video indexing operations in a single API request. For details about this feature, see the [Cloud-to-Cloud Transfers](/guides/uploading-videos/cloud-to-cloud-transfers) page.

The **Dashboard** page allows you to download the list of videos in your AWS S3 bucket as a JSON, and you can provide transcriptions by editing this file in a plain-text editor.

## Prerequisites

* You already downloaded the list of videos in your AWS S3 bucket.

* Your transcription files reside on an AWS S3 bucket, and they're publicly accessible.

* Your transcription must be in the SRT or VTT format.

* Your videos must meet the following requirements:  
   * **Video resolution:** must be greater or equal than 360p and less than 1080p (FHD)  
   * **Duration**: must be between 15 seconds and 2 hours (7,200s) If you require different options, send us an email at `support[at]twelvelabs.io`.

## Recommendations

* For consistent search results, Twelve Labs recommends you upload 360p videos.

## Procedure

1\. Open the JSON file containing the videos you want to upload and update the `transcription` fields by adding the S3 URLs of your transcription files. The following example adds two transcription files: `01.srt` and `02.srt`:

\[

{

"index\_id": "629d807aa9e2a3a33a92c00b1",

"language": "en",

"object": "s3://twelve-labs-docs/01.mp4",

"transcription": "s3://twelve-labs-docs/01.srt"

},

{

"index\_id": "629d807aa9e2a3a33a92c00b",

"language": "en",

"object": "s3://twelve-labs-docs/02.mp4",

"transcription": "s3://twelve-labs-docs/02.srt"

}

\]

2\. Declare the `indexes/tasks/transfers` endpoint:

Python

Node.js

INDEXES\_TASKS\_TRANSFER\_URL \= f"{API\_URL}/indexes/tasks/transfer"

const INDEXES\_TASKS\_TRANSFER\_URL \= \`${API\_URL}/indexes/tasks/transfer\`

2\. Read your JSON file. Open a stream making sure to replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values:

Python

Node.js

file\_path \= "<YOUR\_FILE\_PATH>"

file\_name \= "<YOUR\_FILE\_NAME>"

file\_stream \= open(file\_path, "rb")

const file\_path \= '<YOUR\_FILE\_PATH>'

const file\_stream \= fs.createReadStream(file\_path)

3\. If you're using Python, store the file to upload in an array named `file_param` and specify that you want to make a `multipart/form-data` request. If you're using Node.js, store the file to upload in a variable named `formData` of type `FormData`:

Python

Node.js

file\_param \= \[

("file", (file\_name, file\_stream, "multipart/form-data")),

\]

let formData \= new FormData()

formData.append('file', file\_stream)

4\. Upload the JSON file. Call the [indexes/tasks/transfer](/reference/api-reference/indexes-tasks-transfers) endpoint, store the result in a variable named `response`, and print the status code and the response:

Python

Node.js

requests.post(INDEXES\_TASKS\_TRANSFER\_URL, headers\=headers, files\=file\_param)

print (f"Status code: {response.status\_code}")

pprint (response.json())

let config \= {

method: 'post',

url: INDEXES\_TASKS\_TRANSFER\_URL,

headers: headers,

data : formData,

};

resp \= await axios(config)

response \= await resp.data

console.log(\`Status code: ${resp.status}\`)

console.log(response)

The output should look similar to the following one:

Status code: 200

{

 'message': 'Succesfully requested indexing task',

 'type': 'index\_task\_create'

}
