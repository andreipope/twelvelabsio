title: "Extracting Information from Videos"
---

Videos contain combinations of images, spoken words, sounds, movements, and text. When you have a large library of videos, it might be difficult to know what's in your videos and how to write a query that finds the exact moments you need. Although the API service doesn't automatically extract any tags from your videos and doesn't require you to use them when you perform searches, extracting information that appears in a video can help you get insights into the content of your videos. Instead of watching the entire video and annotating it manually, you can use information extracted by the API service to perform more fine-grained searches.

Depending on your use case, proceed to one of the following sections:
