description: "Use the Twelve Labs Video Understanding API to extract information from your
videos and make it available to your applications."

The API is organized around
REST and returns responses in the JSON format. It is compatible with most
programming languages, and you can also use Postman or other REST clients to
send requests and view responses.

## Call an Endpoint

To call an endpoint, you must construct a URL similar to the following one:

```
{Method} {BaseURL}/{version}/{resource}/{path_parameters}?{query_parameters}
```

The list below describes each component of a request:

- **Method**: The API supports the following methods:

  - `GET`: Reads data.
  - `POST`: Creates a new object or performs an action.
  - `PUT`: Updates an object.
  - `DELETE:` Deletes an object.  
    Note that the `POST` and `PUT` methods require you to pass a request body
    containing additional parameters.

- **Base URL**: The base URL of the API is `https://api.twelvelabs.io`.

- **Version**: Must be set to `v1`.

- **Resource**: The name of the resource you want to interact with.

- **Path Parameters**: Allow you to indicate a specific object. For example, you
  can retrieve details about an engine or index.

- **Query Parameters**: Any parameters that an endpoint accepts. For example,
  you can [filter](/concepts/filtering) or [sort](/concepts/sorting) a response
  using query parameters.

Note that the API requires you to pass a header parameter containing your API
key to authenticate each request. For details, see the
[Authentication](/guides/authentication) page.
