This page outlines the roadmap for Twelve Labs Video Understanding API. Note that Twelve Labs is continuously adding new features based on customer feedback. As a result, this roadmap is not exhaustive and is subject to change.

- **Extend the cloud-to-cloud video transfer feature**: Initially, this feature is supported for the `us-west-2` region of AWS S3. Later, this feature will be extended to all the regions and to Microsoft Azure and GCP.

- **Add new engines**. Each engine will use its own family of deep learning models to index data and will offer different types of indexing options.

- **Data centricity**: Add support for fine-tuning the default SOTA model with your data. This allows you to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and adapt the AI model to your needs.
